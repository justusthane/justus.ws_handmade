            <h1>Why does this website exist</h1>
            
            <p>It's a mild allergic reaction to social media. Itâ€™s a place to put things I care about. It's in the tradition of putting time into creating a personal website as a creative expression. Remember GeoCities? It's a modern GeoCities site. It's Web 1.0. It's a personal website.</p>

            <p>It's inspired by <a href="https://grupstrarules.com/">grupstrarules.com</a>, the website of a guy I thought was pretty cool in high school, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060908213315/http://www.bobbyburgess.net/journal/?date=20060321">bobbyburgess.net/journal</a>, a blog I used to love. All that remains of Bobby Burgess is what can be found on the Wayback Machine, which isn't much. You got the sense from his blog he had a hard life. I wonder what happened to him.</p>

            <p>I also believe it's in your best interest to control your online brand, no matter who you are. You should determine the first result when someone <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=justus+grunow">googles</a> your name. Don't hand over control of your digital life to the tech giants.</p>
